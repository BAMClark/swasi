We know that you are excited to come to UO and we can’t wait for you to join us! To help us help future students have a smoother transition, we would like to learn more from you and your classmates about why this would be so. That is, why might students initially pay attention to the physical environment of UO but ultimately become more familiar with it and pay less attention to it?

 
As you reflect and write, please illustrate your description with examples from your own thoughts about coming to UO or Eugene. You may also draw on your past experiences and on the stories you just read, which are copied below.  

 

Note: Your essay may be provided, anonymously, to incoming UO students in future years to help give them a better understanding of what coming to UO is like. The more you can describe what you anticipate experiencing the more future students will benefit. Thank you for your time and effort."

We know that you are excited to come to UO and we can’t wait for you to join us! To l help us help future students have a smoother transition, we would like to learn more from you and your classmates about the common worries and challenges students face when they come to UO and how students overcome these challenges.         

 

In the space below please describe the thoughts, feelings, and worries you have as you prepare to come to UO.

 

Please describe:



	Thoughts you have about how your background may influence your experiences coming to UO
	Strategies you might use to be successful at UO
	Resources you could rely on for help and support when you need it


 
As you reflect and write, please consider specific experiences you will have at UO during your first year like meeting new people, joining student groups, interacting with professors, and taking classes.    

 

You may draw on your past experiences with other transitions (like starting at another college, starting high school, changing jobs, etc.) and on the stories you just read, which are copied below. Please take as much time as you like.    

 

Note: Your essay may be provided, anonymously, to incoming UO students in future years to help give them a better understanding of what coming to UO is like. The more you can describe the challenges you anticipate facing in coming to UO and how you can respond to these challenges over time, the more future students will benefit. Thank you for your time and effort."
